§2Yeah. Hey guys so this is Shroud, I got a really important announcement for you guys.

§3Umm...

§2Madrinas is being launched in over 700 different Walmarts across 43 different states, and I'm gonna make a 10-15 second clip of me going over there, going over to the Madrinas shelf, picking up a Madrinas.

§3You guys are going to go with me. Don't know what I'm going to do with it, drink it probably, who knows.

§2But yeah, just thought I should let you guys know.





§3Hey what's up guys we're here at Walmart.

§2We're at the Madrinas shelf here. So they got some Cold Brew Blacks, in here.

§3They also got some Café Vanillas.

§2And lastly they got some Café Mochas, but you know what? I'm not seeing any Insane Cappuccino.

§3The hell's going on man?

§2Fuck it. We'll just get the mocha. Fuck it.





§3Just got out of Walmart, and I bought like, 12 cans of Madrinas. Even though I get that shit for free, just want to let you guys know.

§2Flex.

§3Ahhhhhh. I'm outta here.





§2Just want to let you guys know, I came back for the can. Okay I'm gonna recycle it, I'm an adult.

§3And, you guys could head on over to madrinascoffee.com/irl, type in your zip code, find a local Walmart near you, and get your own Madrinas. Alright?
